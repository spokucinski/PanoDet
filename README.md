## Datasets

> **WARNING**
> 
> Generally speaking, datasets used in the repository projects are images of a very specific type.
> They are mostly in the format of equirectangular panoramas and from the context of domestic environment.
> Because of the high concentration of user-specific personal data **the access may be limited to verified users only**.
> 
> In some cases the datasets were published a long time ago, before most of the privacy regulations and are freely available online.
> In such cases we redirect viewers to the original project sites.
>
> In some cases the datasets are novel and fresh.
> In such cases, the privacy of the people sharing the images is the top priority and I do my best to secure it.
> The images may contain manually-checked pictures with blurred areas, covering critically private parts.
> 
> Images present a private indoor domestic environment - it should stay private and the use of collected pictures is expected to be strictly monitored.
