      "I want you to generate a flat, rectangular equirectangular panorama image with a 2:1 aspect ratio. Try to place the camera in the middle of the room to capture the surroundings in full. Do not place a camera in one corner - camera's position in the middle of the room is typical. The image should have a 2:1 aspect ratio, provide a full 360-degree horizontal and 180-degree vertical field of view, suitable for a virtual tour viewer. After transforming the panorama to a 360-degree view, it should be continuous. It also should include a typical equirectangular distortion and some camera noise, but if you cannot fully include this technical attribute required for seamless integration into virtual tour software, do what you can to make it as similar to reality as possible. The equirectangular panorama should cover the whole image space (it is a must, so do not include any frames or padding). The equirectangular panorama depicts a bathroom at night decorated in a elegant contemporary style with the typical items of furniture. Remember that a typical room has some kind of a door. Please try to create a typical room, so focus on typicality of different furniture items in a given room type and also on the typicality of each item's context.
