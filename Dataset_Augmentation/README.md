# Intro
Sub-project dedicated to experiments with data augmentation for the equirectangular imaginery.

# Description
Equirectangular panoramas, as a very specific type of omnidirectional environment visualization, have some typical abberations and properties.
Use of random image augmentations leads this properties to vanish. 
In this project we experiment and check, what popular image augmentation techniques can be savely introduced to equirectangular panoramas.
